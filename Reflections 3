When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want tp use a remote repository when i when I am working with other people on a singular project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not always want to keep the changes made.
