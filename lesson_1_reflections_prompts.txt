The diff command gave me the option to spot 
a bug without having to look manually. 


Knowing what I did in the past adds to efficiency since i 
will be able to recognize previous additions made and how
it affected the program. It can also work as a backup in case
any programming goes poorly. 

They add different files at a time because google docs is
designed to handle one document not many.

They help me keep track of my progress and what I need and
don't need to do

It would make me more confident because i know that there is
a backup that will save me if things go awry

I want to use the workspace provided by git on a lot of my home projects
because it is powerful in the sense that i would like to 
see the progression of my work.
